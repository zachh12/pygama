Processing software for COHERENT Germanium experiment
NOW:
- Make nice toy waveform set from MJD
URGENT:
- Implement variable visualization with show_transform.py
- Change clock speed to clock for SIS3316 digitizer versus GRETINA
- Pass timestamp from tier1 to tier2
TODO:
- Check that timestamps follow proper UNIX timestamps and align with ORCA
- Determine how variable length waveforms effect the chunk processing in t0 processing
- Add Tier 3 processing, look into whether we can use chunking to speed up for cluster runs
- Calculate t0
